#About Me 

My name is jacob shrum, I always wanted to work in healthcare or the tech field and I got the opportunity for CODE:YOU from SOAR. I have an associates degree in Information Technology but have been unable to find work in it, I have always had an interest in coding in general. I used to want to be a game designer.
